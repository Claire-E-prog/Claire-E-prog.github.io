## Projects

![docker-lambda-arm64: Guide for multi-architecture builds](assets/images/project1.png)
**Description**: Deploying ML models on AWS Lambda is scalable and cost-effective but memory limits and architecture mismatches can pose challenges. 
This guide offers tips to resolve architecture-related issues in multi-platform Docker builds for seamless containerized ML deployments on Lambda.

![Lambda-S3-ML Pipeline](assets/images/project2.png)
**Description**: This project deploys a classification model as an AWS Lambda endpoint, comparing zip file uploads with Docker containers. 
It tackles memory constraints and dependency issues, ultimately resolved by containerizing the model and deployin lambda via image stored in AWS ECR.
